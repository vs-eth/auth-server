# This file is sourced by dirsrv upon startup to set
# the default environment for all directory server instances.
# To set instance specific defaults, use the file in the same
# directory called dirsrv-instance where "instance"
# is the name of your directory server instance e.g.
# dirsrv-localhost for the slapd-localhost instance.

# This file is in systemd EnvironmentFile format - see man systemd.exec

# In order to make more file descriptors available to the directory server,
# first make sure the system hard limits are raised, then use ulimit -
# uncomment out the following line and change the value to the desired value
#ulimit -n 8192
# note - if using systemd, ulimit won't work -  you must edit the systemd unit
# file for directory server to add the LimitNOFILE option - see "man
# systemd.exec" for more info

# A per instance keytab does not make much sense for servers.  Kerberos clients
# use the machine FQDN to obtain a ticket like ldap/FQDN, there is nothing that
# can make a client understand how to get a per-instance ticket.  Therefore by
# default a keytab should be considered a per server option.
#
# Also this file is sourced for all instances, so again all instances would
# ultimately get the same keytab.
#
# Finally a keytab is normally named either krb5.keytab or <service>.keytab
#
# In order to use SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) the directory server needs to know
# where to find its keytab file - uncomment the following line and set the
# path and filename appropriately.
# If using systemd, omit the "; export VARNAME" at the end.
KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/dirsrv/ds.keytab

# How many seconds to wait for the startpid file to show up before we assume
# there is a problem and fail to start.
# If using systemd, omit the "; export STARTPID_TIME" at the end.
#STARTPID_TIME=10 ; export STARTPID_TIME

# How many seconds to wait for the pid file to show up before we assume there
# is a problem and fail to start.
# If using systemd, omit the "; export PID_TIME" at the end.
#PID_TIME=600 ; export PID_TIME

# The tcmalloc memory allocator has been shown to have a positive impact on
# the Directory Server's virtual & resident memory size/growth.  tcmalloc is
# available on RHEL/Fedora in the gperftools-libs package (this could be
# different on other platforms).
# If using systemd, omit the "; export LD_PRELOAD" at the end.
#LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc.so.4 ; export LD_PRELOAD
